__This is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on fire dispatch data provided to HACK Oregon Emergency Response Team. The goal for this analysis is to find out the interesting pattern or trend between different years accross different Fire Management Area (FMA). I first connected to the AWS EC2 instance where the database resides. Secondly, I extracted the data from different tables and calculated the time between response steps for a given incident. After checked the overview and distribution, I threw out some obvious incorrect data. Finally, I calculated means and plot them against years and FMAs.__

__Based on the analysis, average Response_Time is 6.92 min, and average OnScene_Time is 30.44 min during the period from 2010 to 2016. The average OnScene_Time decreased from 30.87 min in 2010 to 27.72 min in 2016, while average Response_Time did not change very much. The analysis also showed most of the FMA performed very consistent over the years-- the mean Response_Time and OnScene_Time did not vary very much (see Cell 68 and 70). It is worth noting that the OnScene_Time varies in a much larger scale. For example, four FMA mean values are below 10 min, maybe need further investigation (Cell 61).__
